<!-- <center></center>
The obsolete HTML Center Element (<center>) is a block-level element that displays its block-level or inline contents centered horizontally 
within its containing element. The container is usually, but isn't required to be, <body>.

NOTE:
Applying text-align:center to a <div> or <p> element centers the contents of those elements while leaving their overall dimensions unchanged.
